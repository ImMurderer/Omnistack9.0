# Omnistack 9.0 By Joao P.

This project is in progress, it uses MERN Stack to achieve **AirCNC** 
idea.

## Goal.

The main goal is an platform where tech business owners can sign up
their business to accommodate Devs, giving them the infraestructure to 
program while also giving networking oportunities.

The app consists of 2 frontends, one for devs searching these 
services, and one for business that serve this kind of service. In 
addition to a backend to store information about the service.

# Details
Although the project is deployed, Heroku gets rid of all image uploads after dyno restart, so both fronts will not show older images.
It is also important to remember that React-Native doesnt shows http images, even if they're in local development server.
